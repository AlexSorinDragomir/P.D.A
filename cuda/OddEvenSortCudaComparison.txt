In order to show the practical effects of the algorithm, I tested this using  3 different approaches: sequential implementation, multi thread implementation and CUDA implementation. 
This were  executed on a machine with NVidia GPU. Technical
features of the machine used for testing are Intel i3
processor, 4 GB RAM and GeForce 820M with 2GB
VRAM, set up under Windows 8.1 operating system.
CUDA 7.0 paradigm and C++ is used for CUDA
implementation.

Test Cases: 

Array size = 200
CPU - sequential: 0.13s
CPU – multi thread: 0.07s
GPU: 0.19s


Array size = 500

CPU - sequential: 0.21s
CPU – multi thread: 0.15s 
GPU: 0.43s
